\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to create an inexpensive and non-intrusive hearing aid 
bracelet that provides an alternate channel for sound recognition for our users in their 
surroundings. First of all, Synesthesia Wear's main goal is to be able to provide an 
improved quality of life for our users by instilling within them a sense of comfort 
knowing that our bracelet can help alleviate their hearing difficulties in many environments. 
For this project, there will be 3 main aspects that must be done for its overall completion. 
The first one is to be able to design and create a small and lightweight bracelet that 
is comfortable for our users to wear while encompassing all the hardware needed for 
overall functionality. Simultaneously, the second aspect is one where the bracelet's 
sound detection is able to reliably detect as many significant sounds in our users' daily 
lives as possible. Lastly, an app is going to be made so that it has a user-friendly user interface (UI) that is easy to use and will allow users to easily be able to configure their sound 
detection settings for their bracelets.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
\textbf{N/A}

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of this project would be people in the general public who would want or 
need an inexpensive and non-intrusive bracelet that helps with their hearing. Furthermore, 
people who are in loud environments may want to purchase Synesthesia Wear as well since 
hearing is likely obstructed and sound recognition through touch/vibration would be very 
appealing.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
The Developers:
The developers of this project are the members of Strone. Our job is to develop a 
bracelet that is capable of assisting in the sound recognition of users within their 
surroundings. Throughout this project's entirety, we will test and change/improve 
aspects that we may deem necessary.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
The Synesthesia Wear application should be able to run on many computers, laptops, and
phones. For phones, the application will be supported on IOS and Android OS. 
Furthermore, for laptops/computers, the application will be supported by macOS and Windows 
OS. With all this in mind, it is assumed that implementing for other mobile/laptop/computer 
OS's would be unprofitable and wasteful to maintain.   

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{figure}[h]

  \path [connector] (app) -- (bracelet); 
  \path [connector] (device) -- (app);
  \path [connector] (user) -- (device);
  \path [connector] (user) |- (bracelet);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Implementation Environment}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
Synesthesia Wear does not have any partner or collaborative applications. However, it 
does rely upon the fact that the user is using the application on a device that supports
IOS, Android, macOS, or Windows OS. 

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
There is no specific anticipated workplace environment for this product. Ideally, this 
bracelet and corresponding app can be used anywhere so long as they have a device that 
supports IOS, Android, macOS, or Windows OS.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
It has been decided that this project is to be completed by the week of April 5th, 2022.
As a result, this project's scheduling will be executed over a timespan of a bit more 
than 7 months.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
For this project, the budget has been dictated to be no more than \$750 from the entirety 
of all group members. With this in mind, there is no issues with the application as all 
software tools and resources are expected to use open-source material found online. Thus, 
most/all of the budget will likely be spent towards designing and creating the lightweight, 
non-intrusive, and comfortable bracelet.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The finished application will be available for anyone to use. However, the Synesthesia Wear 
bracelet will need to be purchased as it costs money and time to buy all the components and 
build it.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
There are a few rules that the team must adhere to during the development of this
project. Firstly, each developer must attend the group meeting before the submission
of a deliverable to ensure that everyone has given their opinions and approval of the
work, sort out any discrepancies, correct errors, and then satisfactorily submit with
some time to spare. Furthermore, another rule that must be adhered is the fact that 
each developer has the right to question and ask for further explanations from others 
on their work. This is because both/all parties' work is related in some way or another 
and so the extra clarification and effort would be to all developers' benefit. 

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The developers are assuming that all software resources that will be used in the 
creation of the project will be open source software that is free for us to use. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the majority/all of our users will have access to 
a device that supports macOS, Windows OS, IOS, or Android OS.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Requirements Likely/Unlikely to Change}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{FR} The functional requirements that were stated above are likely to remain the same as they are fundamental to the creation of the product. If any functional requirement happens to change, it would only be a slight deviation from the current requirements.
  \item \textbf{NFR-9} This non-functional requirement is likely to change as the processing time depends on the microcontroller we use. Ideally, we would use a high-speed microcontroller, however, cost and size are trade offs here. As a result, the processing times may change.
  \item \textbf{NFR-12} The battery life may vary according to the size and cost of the battery. Additionally, power consumption from the microcontroller will have to be considered when calculating the battery life. After further research into batteries and power consumption, will we be able to adjust this non-functional requirement to see if 12 hours of use is feasible.
  \item \textbf{NFR-14} this non-functional requirement may need to be adjusted to more or less keywords being able to detect. This is dependent on the size of memory the microcontroller has.
  \item \textbf{NFR-21} this non-functional requirement may be changed to only interface with IOS mobile devices as we have limited development time.

\section*{Reflection Appendix}
This section deals with what knowledge and experiences each team member will need 
to acquire so that the capstone project can be completed successfully. With that in 
mind, before identifying what each member is going to learn/master, some approaches 
of learning need to be established. Firstly, we believe that one of our main approaches 
to learning/mastering new skills is by scouring the internet for resources, videos, websites, 
blogs, or any other notable sources for relevant information. Another approach would be to 
look through books at McMaster's library to see if there is any applicable details that could 
be used for this project. Furthermore, one could also master their new skills via practice 
and trial-and-error by following tutorials and then trying to do them in real-time. Lastly, a 
final approach could be to find someone with relevant expertise and ask them for advice or 
some lessons on relevant skills/knowledge that would be beneficial for the project as a whole.

\subsection*{Jordan Bierbrier}
The knowledge that Jordan needs to acquire during this project is signal processing within a microcontroller. This is a crucial step for the project because we need to filter the incoming noise and extract meaningful information from the sound. This knowledge is important for the future as many products and technologies include signal processing. In order to learn more about signal processing, Jordan will talk to experts within the field to learn more about the techniques that are implemented. For example, past professors have a wealth of knowledge and there is a lot they can teach. Meetings will have to be scheduled with professors to learn more about the topics. Additionally, reviewing their course content would also help enrich Jordan’s knowledge of signal processing.   \\

\subsection*{Azriel Gingoyon}
The knowledge that Azriel needs to acquire for this project will be that of electrical 
circuitry and mechanical design. This is because he needs to be able to understand and 
learn of feasible, efficient, and effective ways to design the bracelet so that it can 
incorporate all of the necessary hardware for overall functionality while being non-intrusive 
for the user's comfortability. In terms of skills, it is most likely that he will need to 
become more proficient in CAD design, PCB design, circuit diagrams, and component research for 
cost-effective hardware to be used in the project.
\newline

\noindent
In regards to approaches to acquiring said knowledge or mastering these skills, Azriel believes
that the approach he should use is to scour the internet to learn more relevant information as 
well as do tutorials to improve applicable skills. This is because it is very effective to learn 
about new things from the web and its large databases of information. Furthermore, mastering skills 
can only be done through repetition and practice while continuously trying to learn new tricks/skills 
along the way.

\subsection*{Taranjit Lotey}
Knowledge of object-orientated programming for application development \\
Will be utilizing the web to master skills needed to have a deployable application.
Main focus will be on retaining information on certain functions and header files 
needed to create a user interface. Proxy communication will be required to communicate 
between the backend embedded system and frontend application.\\

\subsection*{Udeep Shah}
One of my approaches would be to learn from the web through articles and research documents. The other is to learn from my teammates.
For signal processing and filtering I would learn from research documents and web articles as these are more comprehensive and have a lot of detail for easy understanding of topics. For the writing aspect I would learn from my teammates as many of them have had to write requirements and technical documentation (software) that I have not done before. I select this approach as simply looking up on the web makes it a little too complicated in this case.


\subsection*{Abraham Taha}
The knowledge that Abraham needs to acquire for this project will include signal processing, mobile application development and speech recognition algorithms. Being the only software engineering student on the team these skills will be essential to creating the Front-end software portion of the project. Furthermore, improving knowledge in speech recognition will be essential for the core requirement of capturing keywords out of a data stream of sounds. More specifically, working with the programming languages of Swift and Java as they pertain to developing mobile applications will also be a key part of creating the final product. 
\newline

\noindent
These skills will be acquired through numerous avenues. First off, Youtube tutorials will be the main method. Youtube has a vast amount of resources for differing knowledge levels. Other avenues will include forum sites such as StackOverflow, these types of websites are useful for debugging programs through community help. Finally, another methodology for learning these skills will come from taking advantage of the opportunities at McMaster. Speaking with different professors who have experience in these issues will be great resources as we complete this project.
