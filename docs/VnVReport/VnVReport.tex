\section{Purpose}

This VnV report's establishment is to support development of the product Synesthesia Wear. Furthermore, the actions taken in the document are linked with testing to ensure reliability and robustness of the product for adequate detection of particular sounds.

\section{Scope}

The focus of this document is on the output results of Synesthesia Wear when given arbitrary test inputs. Furthermore, black box testing will be used on important aspects of the output and input rather than how the results are being generated. Lastly, these tests will be based on certain implementations we have put into place to handle unexpected inputs.

\section{Background} 

Synesthesia wear is designed with a mobile application which allows customization to occur from their mobile devices and allows users to toggle certain sounds on and off to improve usability of the watch. Synesthesia wear will be able to detect key words and sounds that are customized to the users to aid them with their lack of hearing. As a result, this helps them know when someone is calling their name, during emergencies, and many other situations within their daily lives.

\section{Verification Plan}
\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} \textcolor{red}{The SRS was reviewed by teammates working in groups of two. This was done in groups so that teammates can discuss between each other to verify and validate our SRS. This also helped to iron out the previous issues and feedback we had received from our peers.}
  \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} \textcolor{red}{The key functional requirements and some key non-functional requirements were discussed with external stakeholders. Some non-functional requirements were not discussed as they were not deemed to be important. 
  The external stakeholders that were consulted for our project were Dr. Martin von. Mohrenschildt and Katherine Hesson-Bolton. Both offered valuable information for our project. Dr. Martin von. Mohrenschildt was consulted at the start and the middle of the project while Katherine Hesson-Bolton was consulted throughout the project. 
  } 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} \textcolor{red}{The design was reviewed by all the teammates together in a library meeting room. The feedback from our peers and the initial design goals were considered.}
  \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} \textcolor{red}{The design was also reviewed by our professor and our TAs during revision 0 demonstration. A lot of feedback about our design was received then, which has resulted in a couple of changes in key areas of our project. 
  }

\section{Unit Testing}
The following test cases were derived from the unit test section shown in Synesthesia Wear's \href{https://github.com/jordanbierbrier/capstone/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{\textit{VnVPlan.pdf Document}} as well as the modules shown in the \href{https://github.com/jordanbierbrier/capstone/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{\textit{MIS.pdf Document}}.
Furthermore, inapplicable tests from the VnVPlan were not included in the following table as they were not feasible with our current implementation. \textcolor{red}{To make the unit tests applicable we will make improvements to the sound classification module and bluetooth communication}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
Test results marked as {\color[HTML]{FE0000} Fail} require revisions in future implementations. 
\subsection{Changes Due to Requirement Tests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add capability to detect sounds at greater distance ($>$15m)
  \item Update sound detection model performance by being more generalizable (i.e. detect sound from different individuals)
  \textcolor{red}{
  \item Increase accuracy by adding sound clips with various environmental sounds.
  \item Change the confidence level of sound detection
  \item Intensity of haptic feedback
}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Changes Due to Unit Tests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add further bluetooth capability to reconnect device with mobile application after device goes in and
   out of range
\textcolor{red}{
  \item Increase sensitivity of microphone
  \item Allow for auto bluetooth connection
}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflection}

After reviewing both the VnV Plan and the VnV Report, it is clear that there are numerous differences between the predicted outputs shown within the VnV plan and the experimental results found in the VnV report. For example, functional requirement test 3 (FRT3) had a 'fail' result in the VnV report compared to the VnV plan which had predicted the same haptic feedback at different distances. With this in mind, these kinds of differences indicate that some of the results were not part of the initial expectations and that the Synesthesia Wear team needs to work on finding ways to remove these inconsistencies to further improve and solidify the product. 

In another regard, some of the differences were found to be based on surveys which will be conducted after the final revision is completed. An example is nonfunctional requirement test 17 (NFRT17) where a survey will be taken for people in different age groups for icons found in the application. The icons are an aesthetic aspect to the app that have not been implemented yet, but by the time this test is run, they will be included before the survey is performed. 

With all this in mind, to improve upon the differences between the two documents, the team will collaboratively brainstorm ideas for fixes/solutions to inconsistent results and possibly try to come up with even more test cases such that it prevents undesirable results from occurring in the first place. For example, testing that invalid sounds are being blocked so that it prevents undesirable haptic feedback from occurring to begin with. Questions that would arise from this train of thought would be concerns like 'what would be considered an invalid keyword?'. Furthermore, thinking about the consequences for the test failures and what the back up plan would have to be in those situations. Lastly, trying to look for alternative options to get the desired output would also be something that needs to be considered.

\subsection{Synthesis}
To conduct our tests, data was required to be collected. Our functional requirement, nonfunctional requirement, and unit tests were carried out to determine the quality and effectiveness of our project. A majority of our tests passed, some were not able to be tested at this point in the development of our project. Additionally, a few tests failed. These are areas in which we will focus our next revision to improve. For example, we could make our sound classification model more robust, since the data we collected (experiments we ran) did not pass expected results. Overall, our goal is to have all of our test results as passes.
