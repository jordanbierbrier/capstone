\section{Purpose}

This VnV report's establishment is to support development of the product Synthesis Wear. The actions taken in the document are linked with testing to ensure reliability and robustness of the product for adequate detection of particular sounds.

\section{Scope}

The focus of this document is on the output results of Synthesis Wear when given arbitrary input. We will using black box testing on important aspects of the output and input rather then how the results are generated. These tests will be based on certain implementations we have put into place to handle unexpected inputs.
