\section{General Information}

\subsection{General Information}

Synesthesia Wear goal is to create a wearable product that allows users to get assisted with certain vocal tasks needing attention. These tasks can be generic or custom to the user as needed. The product will use signal processing to gather information and make a calculated prediction of the required action. This will let the user reach a peace of mind, knowing that if an important call is being directed towards the user then the Synesthesia Wear will alert them.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the document is to prove correctness of the system requirements and the system design documents by using unit and system testing for adequate usability. Often software may have bugs that is experienced by end-user. The tests stated in the document will show signs of mitigating those issues which will ensure the underlying logic for the subsystems. This will be completed by rigorous unit testing on the functional and non-functional requirements. The code and the circuitry tested will be the underlying logic which interact with the database.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
The scope of the unit testing will involve evaluating the microphone, bluetooth, 
classification, feedback, noise filter, and interface modules to see if they adhere 
to respective functional and non-functional requirements found in Synesthesia Wear’s 
SRS document.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Microphone Module}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
This section deals with what knowledge, experiences, and approaches each team member will need to acquire/pursue so that the verification and validation of Synesthesia Wear can be completed successfully.
To start off, the collective knowledge and skills that the team would need to acquire includes dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, Mocha skills, Mongo Orchestration skills, and ESLint skills.
With that in mind, an approach that we could use to learn/master the new knowledge or skills would be scouring the internet for resources, videos, websites, blogs, or any other notable sources for relevant information.
Another approach would be to look through relevant books at McMaster's library or any other library to see if there is any applicable details that could be used for this document.
Furthermore, one could also master their new skills via practice and trial-and-error by following tutorials and then trying to do them in real-time.
Lastly, a final approach could be to find someone with relevant expertise and ask them for advice or some lessons on relevant skills/knowledge that would be beneficial for the completion of the Verification and Validation of our project.



\subsection*{Jordan Bierbrier}
The knowledge that Jordan needs to acquire during this project is Static Testing knowledge.
This is because he needs to be able to theoretically test whether the signal processing aspects of the product will work based on an examination of the code.
To further clarify, the hardware needed for the signal processing may not always be set up for testing.
So, Jordan should learn Static Testing knowledge so that he can still test at all times even when the hardware is not set up and the code is not running.
To add on, although the actual results of the signal processing may not be able to be verified, Jordan can still test the logic of the code such as the flow of signals over bluetooth from the bracelet to the app.
With all this in mind, the approaches Jordan should take would include scouring the internet for resources on static testing knowledge as well as asking experts with testing experience to see if they have any advice.
These two approaches were chosen because they would be the most effective and efficient methods of learning static testing knowledge.

\subsection*{Azriel Gingoyon}
The knowledge that Azriel needs to acquire during this project is Mocha skills.
This is because he needs to test whether the hardware components are functioning properly and are able to communicate with the app as expected.
To further clarify, all of the hardware needs to be incorporated properly so that everything is working properly.
So, if the design and hardware are all good, the communication to the hardware should not have too many issues, and so this testing platform would help with that.
With all this in mind, the approaches Azriel should take would include scouring the internet for resources on Mocha as well as trying trial-and-error/practice to further solidify the Mocha skills that he is learning.

To search the McMaster professor profolios form previous years to find experts in our relevant topics which require attention. Approach one would be asking the professor of our Captsone project to suggest professors which would align with our needs the best. Approach two would be going back to previous courses and find out which professors taught topics related to the issue/interest at hand.


\subsection*{Udeep Shah}
Find information required to successfully finish research and understanding the topic I would reach for the help of relatable books. This would be possible by using online library search engines to find matching summaries. Also use the help of online resources to find which books have problems or solutions related to the one at hand.

\subsection*{Abraham Taha}
The knowledge that Abraham needs to acquire during this project is Dynamic Testing knowledge.
This is because he needs to be able to continuously test whether the app aspects of the product are working as expected.
To further clarify, as the app is continuously being developed to meet all requirements and preferences of our users, it is essential to ensure that other aspects of the app are still functioning properly.
With all this in mind, the approaches Abraham should take would include scouring the internet for resources on dynamic testing knowledge as well as asking experts with testing experience to see if they have any advice.
These two approaches were chosen because they are the most effective and efficient methods of learning dynamic testing knowledge.
