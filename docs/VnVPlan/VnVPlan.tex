\section{General Information}

\subsection{General Information}

Synesthesia Wear goal is to create a wearable product that allows users to get assisted with certain vocal tasks needing attention. These tasks can be generic or custom to the user as needed. The product will use signal processing to gather information and make a calculated prediction of the required action. This will let the user reach a peace of mind, knowing that if an important call is being directed towards the user then the Synesthesia Wear will alert them.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the document is to prove correctness of the system requirements and the system design documents by using unit and system testing for adequate usability. Often software may have bugs that is experienced by end-user. The tests stated in the document will show signs of mitigating those issues which will ensure the underlying logic for the subsystems. This will be completed by rigorous unit testing on the functional and non-functional requirements. The code and the circuitry tested will be the underlying logic which interact with the database.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The relevant documents include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hazard Analysis Document
\item Systems Design Document

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for SRS verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} This plan will make each member go through each SRS and verify if each SRS is still within our usability scope.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This will let our stakeholders to go through each SRS and get their perspective on the usage of the product.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves using previously set checklists in our SRS document which will verify conditions being met.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The following show our plan to review the Design verification :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} The planned objective is to go through a high-fidelity prototype or functional prototype to verify if the design meets expected data of the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This plan involves going through the design of the project with our stakeholders to see if the prototype meets expectations set in the SRS.

    Output &   UI should behave as required in terms of appearance and style.  \\
    \hline
    Test Case Derivation &   Gathering information on the wants of the users to ensure that the interface adheres to their preferences and that they are pleased with their user experiences. \\
    \hline
    How test will be performed & A sample group of 5 people will have the opportunity to interact with the UI and device first. They will later be asked questions regarding certain features of the product. These questions are listed in the appendix. If a satisfying result is obtained over the sample group, then the test is passed. This test has multiple subsections where each can be passed or failed separately. \\

    Test Case Derivation &   The device has to be able to respond quickly to any user input. \\
    \hline
    How test will be performed & It will be too hard to measure the response time manually as most humans have a response time greater than 1ms. Hence this test will be done with the help of helper code which will calculate the time between a user input detected and a corresponding change in the UI. \\

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{How did the finish and look of the device appeal to you?\\}
\item{How was the appearance of different pages in the UI software?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: Satisfied or better for both questions above.


\subsubsection{Style Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{Did you feel that there was consistency between different elements of the UI?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: Yes.


\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{Out of 10, how easy do you find it to interact with the UI?\\}
\item{Out of 10, what would you rate the usability of the system?\\}
\item{What do you find most frustrating about the system?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: For the first two questions, the average score has to be greater than 7. The last question should not have the same answer repeated between different members. If so, it would suggest an issue with the system. 


\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{Were you satisfied with the personalization choices of the UI?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: Should be yes for 85\% of the sample group. 


\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{How long did it take you to understand and use the software on your own?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: Should not be longer than 5 minutes for each person in the sample group. 


\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item{How difficult was it to read information off the screen?\\}
\item{Were you satisfied with the arrangement of content on the screen?\\}
\item{Were you displeased with the language or content used on the UI?\\}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Expected answers for pass condition: For the first condition, the difficulty should not be more than 6 out of 10. For the second condition, it should be yes for 85\% of the sample group. For the third condition, it should be no for all members of the sample group.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

This section deals with what knowledge and experiences each team member will need 
to acquire so that the capstone project can be completed successfully. With that in 
mind, before identifying what each member is going to learn/master, some approaches 
of learning need to be established. Firstly, we believe that one of our main approaches 
to learning/mastering new skills is by scouring the internet for resources, videos, websites, 
blogs, or any other notable sources for relevant information. Another approach would be to 
look through books at McMaster's library to see if there is any applicable details that could 
be used for this project. Furthermore, one could also master their new skills via practice 
and trial-and-error by following tutorials and then trying to do them in real-time. Lastly, a 
final approach could be to find someone with relevant expertise and ask them for advice or 
some lessons on relevant skills/knowledge that would be beneficial for the project as a whole.
