\section{General Information}

\subsection{General Information}

Synesthesia Wear goal is to create a wearable product that allows users to get assisted with certain vocal tasks needing attention. These tasks can be generic or custom to the user as needed. The product will use signal processing to gather information and make a calculated prediction of the required action. This will let the user reach a peace of mind, knowing that if an important call is being directed towards the user then the Synesthesia Wear will alert them.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the document is to prove correctness of the system requirements and the system design documents by using unit and system testing for adequate usability. Often software may have bugs that is experienced by end-user. The tests stated in the document will show signs of mitigating those issues which will ensure the underlying logic for the subsystems. This will be completed by rigorous unit testing on the functional and non-functional requirements. The code and the circuitry tested will be the underlying logic which interact with the database.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The relevant documents include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hazard Analysis Document
\item Systems Design Document

\end{itemize}


\section{Plan}


\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The following project members are responsible for all procedures of the verification and validation. Responsibilities can be executing and writing tests :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jordan Bierbrier 
    \item Udeep Shah
    \item Taranjit Lotey
    \item Abraham Taha
    \item Azriel Gingoyon
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for SRS verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} This plan will make each member go through each SRS and verify if each SRS is still within our usability scope.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This will let our stakeholders to go through each SRS and get their perspective on the usage of the product.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves using previously set checklists in our SRS document which will verify conditions being met.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The following show our plan to review the Design verification :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} The planned objective is to go through a high-fidelity prototype or functional prototype to verify if the design meets expected data of the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This plan involves going through the design of the project with our stakeholders to see if the prototype meets expectations set in the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves using previously set checklists in our SRS document which will verify conditions being met. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
The following plans indicate our Implementation verification plan:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis:} Test plans in sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 will be using this for test plans.
    \item \textbf{Code Inspection:} This will be used for the test plans in section 5.1.1.
    \item \textbf{Non-functional Testing:} Non-functional Requirements test plans are written in details in section 5.2.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
Automated Testing Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mocha:} Mocha is the oldest testing frameworks for Node.js and hence will be used for our project. It has also evolved with Node.js and the JavaScript language, giving user the opportunity for callbacks, promises and async/await. 
    \item \textbf{Mongo Orchestration:} Mongo Orchestration will be used to test our MongoDB database using the MongoDB process management.
\end{itemize}
Verification Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{EsLint:} ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with a goal to make our code consistent and avoiding bugs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Currently there is no available data that can help validate the software.

  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
The scope of the unit testing will involve evaluating the microphone, bluetooth,

to respective functional and non-functional requirements found in Synesthesia Wear’s 
SRS document.

  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Microphone Module}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

This section deals with what knowledge and experiences each team member will need 
to acquire so that the capstone project can be completed successfully. With that in 
mind, before identifying what each member is going to learn/master, some approaches 
of learning need to be established. Firstly, we believe that one of our main approaches 
to learning/mastering new skills is by scouring the internet for resources, videos, websites, 
blogs, or any other notable sources for relevant information. Another approach would be to 
look through books at McMaster's library to see if there is any applicable details that could 
be used for this project. Furthermore, one could also master their new skills via practice 
and trial-and-error by following tutorials and then trying to do them in real-time. Lastly, a 
final approach could be to find someone with relevant expertise and ask them for advice or 
some lessons on relevant skills/knowledge that would be beneficial for the project as a whole.
