\section{General Information}

\subsection{General Information}

Synesthesia Wear's goal is to create a wearable \sout{product} \textcolor{red}{device} that \sout{assists users with certain vocal tasks that need attention. These tasks can be generic or custom to the user as needed.} \textcolor{red}{improves users' auditory awareness of their surroundings.} Furthermore, the product will use signal processing to gather and analyze information to determine the best and most appropriate feedback (via vibrations) to send to the user. As a result, this gives users peace of mind knowing that if \sout{an important call is being directed towards them} \textcolor{red}{their attention is ever required}, Synesthesia Wear will be able to alert them.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the document is to prove correctness of the \href{https://github.com/jordanbierbrier/capstone/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{\textit{system requirements}} and the \href{https://github.com/jordanbierbrier/capstone/blob/main/docs/Design/SystDesign/SystDes.pdf}{\textit{system design}} documents by using unit and system testing for adequate usability. Furthermore, it is often the case where software may have bugs that is then experienced by the end-users. So, the tests stated in the document will describe ways of mitigating those issues and thus ensuring the underlying logic for all subsystems. This will be completed by rigorous unit testing on the functional and non-functional requirements. Lastly, the code and the circuitry being tested will incorporate the underlying logic that interacts with the database.
\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\section{Plan}


\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The following project members are responsible for all procedures of the verification and validation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jordan Bierbrier  - \textcolor{red}{Embedded signal validation}
    \item Udeep Shah - \textcolor{red}{Hardware validation}
    \item Taranjit Lotey - \textcolor{red}{Application validation}
    \item Abraham Taha - \textcolor{red}{Application validation}
    \item Azriel Gingoyon - \textcolor{red}{Embedded signal validation}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Responsibilities include executing and writing tests.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for SRS verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} This plan involves making each member go through our SRS document and verifying that each requirement is still within our usability scope.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} Our \textcolor{red}{external} stakeholders will get to go through the SRS and gain some perspective on what requirements are supposed to be met while they use the product. \textcolor{red}{Also, insight will be provided by external stakeholders on missing requirements from our SRS}.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves using previously set checklists from our SRS document that will verify which conditions are being met.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The following shows our plans for reviewing the Design verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} The planned objective is to go through a high-fidelity or functional prototype to verify if the design meets the expected data of the SRS document.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This plan involves going through the design of the project with our stakeholders to see if the prototype meets expectations that were set in the SRS. \textcolor{red}{This will be done three times during the course of the project. Firstly it will be done after POC. Then }
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves using previously set checklists from our SRS document that will verify which conditions are being met.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
The following plans indicate our Implementation verification plan:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis:} \textcolor{red}{ All test plans in sections 5 that have code will be using VSCode static analyser extension which reports bugs detected by the Clang Static Analyser.}
    \item \textbf{Code Inspection:} This will be used for all relevant test plans that incorporate code in section 5.
    \item \textbf{Non-functional Testing:} Test plans for Non-functional Requirements are written in detail within section 5.2 of this document.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
Automated Testing Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mocha:} Mocha is the oldest testing framework for Node.js and hence will be used for our project. It has also evolved with Node.js and the JavaScript language, giving users the opportunity for callbacks, promises and async/await. 
    \item \textbf{Mongo Orchestration:} Mongo Orchestration will be used to test our MongoDB database using the MongoDB process management system.
\end{itemize}
Verification Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ESLint:} ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code with a purpose of making code consistent while avoiding bugs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Currently, there is no available data that can help validate the software.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
This section deals with what knowledge, experiences, and approaches each team member will need to acquire/pursue so that the verification and validation of Synesthesia Wear can be completed successfully.
To start off, the collective knowledge and skills that the team would need to acquire includes dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, Mocha skills, Mongo Orchestration skills, and ESLint skills.
With that in mind, an approach that we could use to learn/master the new knowledge or skills would be scouring the internet for resources, videos, websites, blogs, or any other notable sources for relevant information.
Another approach would be to look through relevant books at McMaster's library or any other library to see if there is any applicable details that could be used for this document.
Furthermore, one could also master their new skills via practice and trial-and-error by following tutorials and then trying to do them in real-time.
Lastly, a final approach could be to find someone with relevant expertise and ask them for advice or some lessons on relevant skills/knowledge that would be beneficial for the completion of the Verification and Validation of our project.



\subsection*{Jordan Bierbrier}
The knowledge that Jordan needs to acquire during this project is Static Testing knowledge.
This is because he needs to be able to theoretically test whether the signal processing aspects of the product will work based on an examination of the code.
To further clarify, the hardware needed for the signal processing may not always be set up for testing.
So, Jordan should learn Static Testing knowledge so that he can still test at all times even when the hardware is not set up and the code is not running.
To add on, although the actual results of the signal processing may not be able to be verified, Jordan can still test the logic of the code such as the flow of signals over bluetooth from the bracelet to the app.
With all this in mind, the approaches Jordan should take would include scouring the internet for resources on static testing knowledge as well as asking experts with testing experience to see if they have any advice.
These two approaches were chosen because they would be the most effective and efficient methods of learning static testing knowledge.

\subsection*{Azriel Gingoyon}
The knowledge that Azriel needs to acquire during this project is Mocha skills.
This is because he needs to test whether the hardware components are functioning properly and are able to communicate with the app as expected.
To further clarify, all of the hardware needs to be incorporated properly so that everything is working properly.
So, if the design and hardware are all good, the communication to the hardware should not have too many issues, and so this testing platform would help with that.
With all this in mind, the approaches Azriel should take would include scouring the internet for resources on Mocha as well as trying trial-and-error/practice to further solidify the Mocha skills that he is learning. 

\subsection*{Taranjit Lotey}
To search the McMaster professor profolios form previous years to find experts in our relevant topics which require attention. Approach one would be asking the professor of our Captsone project to suggest professors which would align with our needs the best. Approach two would be going back to previous courses and find out which professors taught topics related to the issue/interest at hand.


\subsection*{Udeep Shah}
Find information required to successfully finish research and understanding the topic I would reach for the help of relatable books. This would be possible by using online library search engines to find matching summaries. Also use the help of online resources to find which books have problems or solutions related to the one at hand.

\subsection*{Abraham Taha}
The knowledge that Abraham needs to acquire during this project is Dynamic Testing knowledge.
This is because he needs to be able to continuously test whether the app aspects of the product are working as expected.
To further clarify, as the app is continuously being developed to meet all requirements and preferences of our users, it is essential to ensure that other aspects of the app are still functioning properly.
With all this in mind, the approaches Abraham should take would include scouring the internet for resources on dynamic testing knowledge as well as asking experts with testing experience to see if they have any advice.
These two approaches were chosen because they are the most effective and efficient methods of learning dynamic testing knowledge.
