\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
In this day and age, communication is a very significant part of our day to day lives. 
So, people who have difficulty in recognizing sounds within their surroundings are not 
able to live their lives to their fullest. For instance, hard of hearing (HoH) individuals 
are not able to always respond promptly whenever their loved ones are calling their name or
when a doorbell rings out for a package delivery. As a result, this can be rather unfortunate
for the HoH individual as inconveniencing loved ones for another appeal or missing a delivery
are both not ideal scenarios to be in. This can especially be the case for life-and-death 
situations where the importance of sound awareness is highlighted. With all this in mind, 
a device which will monitor your surroundings for you would encourage confidence within 
the users to complete daily tasks as well as notably improve their quality of life.

   Goal & Importance \\
   \hline
   Finished device can withstand above moderate environmental conditions such as moisture and heat  & 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item The device will be a wearable technology which makes it a necessity that the user does not need to worry about damage in average daily conditions.  
   \end{itemize} 
   \\
   \hline
  Device can collect and process data in real time while filtering out noise  & 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A core functional aspect of the device is to process a continuous stream of data and react once a key data point is found.
    \item This permits our device to provide the necessary sensory outputs to the user.
  \end{itemize} 
   \\
   \hline
   Finished product can communicate with an external device &   
   \begin{itemize}
    \item A core functional aspect of the device is to process a continuous stream of data and react once a key data point is found.
  \end{itemize}  
  \\
   \hline
   Data collected will be processed and then deleted in real time &    
   \begin{itemize}
    \item A core functional aspect of the device is to process a continuous stream of data and react once a key data point is found.
  \end{itemize}  
   \\
   \hline
   Finished product will retain all functionalities in a form factor that is wearable &    
   \begin{itemize}
    \item A core functional aspect of the device is to process a continuous stream of data and react once a key data point is found.
  \end{itemize}   
  \\
   \hline
   Finished product will be rechargeable and reusable &    
   \begin{itemize}
    \item A core functional aspect of the device is to process a continuous stream of data and react once a key data point is found.

   Goal & Importance \\
   \hline
   Finished product will have a water resistance rating of IPX5 & 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item This will increase usability of the product
    \item This will also avoid the possibility that the device will become malfunctional under certain wet weather conditions.
   \end{itemize} 
   \\
   \hline
   Finished product can actively filter out noise in particularly loud environments   & 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item This will expand the environments where the product can function as intended. This will also lead to more reliable outputs from the device in situations where hearing is more obstructed by noises in the surroundings
   \end{itemize}
   \\
   \hline
   Finished product will support over the air firmware updates & 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item As the product develops and is used in real world applications we predict that the noise detection algorithm we use will keep improving. Having the option to upgrade prior devices with better signal processing through software will aid in extending the usability of older products.
