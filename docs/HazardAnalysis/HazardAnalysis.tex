\section{Introduction}
This document is the hazard analysis for the entirety of Synesthesia Wear.
For context, Synesthesia Wear is an inexpensive and non-intrusive hearing aid 
wearable device with a purpose of improving quality of life by providing users with 
an alternate channel for sound recognition within their surroundings. Furthermore, 
this wearable device will have a corresponding application that will be made to be 
user-friendly so that users can easily access and configure their wearable devices to 
whatever settings they so desire. Lastly, for the purposes of this document, the 
Synesthesia Wear developers believe that the definition of a hazard is one that is 
derived from Nancy Leveson's work. With that in mind, a hazard is any property or 
condition within the Synesthesia Wear system where after pairing up with any 
conditions in the environment, a potential for loss to the system now exists.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of this document is to identify any and all possible hazards within 
the system, clarify the mitigation steps of each identified hazard, determine 
the causes and effects of all failures, and define all safety and security requirements 
that have resulted from the overall analysis.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The hazard analysis will be conducted on the Synesthesia Wear system which will be 
comprised of the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The wearable device consists of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Vibration Motor
        \item Microphone
        \item Microcontroller
        \item Bluetooth module
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Application to be installed on the users' devices consists of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item User Interface
        \item Wearable device Settings Configuration
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Device that runs the application
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Operating System
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent With the above in mind, the system boundary is limited to the above 3 components with 
each having their own respective subcomponents. Furthermore, it is important to note 
that not all components in the above list can be controlled (i.e. Device's Operating 
System) by the Synesthesia Wear developers. However, these components still needed to 
be listed down in the system boundary as the potential for a hazard can still be 
correlated to them.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

CA1. The battery will not need to be replaced during product lifespan.
\\CA2. Signal input devices will be consistent with the results they produce.
\\CA3. Software application failure will not diminish usage of product.
\\CA4. The microphone is not blocked and has full access to the environment.
